Functions for working with p-values and Bayes factors.

This module provides functions for converting between p-values and Bayes
factors, as well as calculating Bayes factors from posterior
distributions. These are useful for hypothesis testing and interpreting
statistical evidence.

def as_bf(

    """
    Convert a one-sided p-value to a Bayes factor.

    This Bayes factor quantifies evidence in favour of a directional effect
    over the null hypothesis of no such effect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvalue : NDArray | float
        The p-value(s) to be converted to Bayes factor(s). Can be a single
        value or an array of values.

    Returns
    -------
    NDArray | float
        The corresponding Bayes factor(s). The return type matches the
        input type.

    --------
    as_pvalue : Convert a Bayes factor to a p-value.

    Notes
    -----
    The Bayes factor is derived from the one-sided p-value using a
    Bayesian interpretation, which quantifies evidence in favor of a
    directional effect over the null hypothesis of no such effect.

    See [1]_ for theoretical details and implications.

    Convert a Bayes factor of a directional effect to a one-sided p-value.

    The Bayes factor quantifies evidence in favour of a directional effect
    over the null hypothesis of no such effect.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bayes_factor : float | NDArray
        The Bayes factor(s) to be converted to p-value(s). Can be a single
        value or an array of values.

    Returns
    -------
    float | NDArray

    [1]_.

def bayes_factor(
    posterior: NDArray,
    threshold: float = 0.0,
    adjustment: Literal[0, 1] = 0,
) -> float:
    """
    Compute the Bayes factor for a test of direction given a threshold.

    The Bayes factor quantifies the evidence in favor of the hypothesis that
    the posterior distribution exceeds the given threshold compared to the
    hypothesis that it does not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    posterior : NDArray
        An array of posterior samples.
    threshold : float, optional
        The threshold value to test against. Default is 0.0.
    adjustment : {0, 1}, optional
        Adjustment to apply to the Bayes factor calculation. Default is 0.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The computed Bayes factor.

    See Also
    --------
    as_pvalue : Convert a Bayes factor to a p-value.

    as_bf : Convert a p-value to a Bayes factor.

    Notes
    -----
    The Bayes factor is a measure of evidence which compares the likelihood of
    the data under two competing hypotheses. In this function, the numerator
    represents the proportion of posterior samples exceeding the threshold,
    while the denominator represents the proportion of samples not exceeding
    the threshold. If all samples exceed the threshold, the Bayes factor is
    set to infinity, indicating overwhelming evidence in favor of the
    hypothesis.

    The adjustment parameter allows for slight modifications to the Bayes
    factor calculation, which can be useful in specific contexts such as
    sensitivity analyses.

    See [1]_ for further theoretical details and practical implications of
    this approach.
